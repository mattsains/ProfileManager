ProfileManager
==============

An android application that switches sound profiles at preset times

#### Goals
1. A simple silent/normal scheduler
2. A Fully customizeable profile switcher

### Grander Project

This (probably fleeting) project comes after a discussion with @bentles about how few good free and open-source mobile apps there are [out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_and_open-source_Android_applications). The ones that are free as in beer are often terribly made and riddled with advertisements.

This is an attempt to make a collection of good-quality mobile apps under the GPL licence.
